For The Bois who are using this.

In order to Work on the Project you must

----------------------------------------

1. Use `git clone "clone url" ` in order to work on the project.
2. Always use `git pull origin ` before you start working. This will sync your repo before you start editing on it.
3. Use `git add "file name" ` in order to add files to the staging area.
4. Use `git commit -m "Note of Change" ` in order to comment to the repo what you changed.
5. Use `git push ` to push the changes you made and make them permanent.


Later we might work with Branches.
